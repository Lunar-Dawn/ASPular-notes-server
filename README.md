# ASPular Notes Server

A very simple ASP.net server for the associated [client](https://github.com/Lunar-Dawn/ASPular-notes-client)
to get and edit its database of notes. 
Right now it only implements extremely simple CRUD operations, all on the 
temporary in-memory DB. Mostly because learning angular is a bigger project
than writing yet another web server.
But this will eventually change as I implement more features on the client.
